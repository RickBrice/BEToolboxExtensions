====================================
Moment Curvature of Circular Columns
====================================
This program computes moment curvature response of circular columns with bonded and unbonded longitudinal reinforcement as well as unbonded prestressed tendons.

Main Window
-----------
The main window consists of an input pane on the left side and four tabbed windows on the right side.

**Column Properties**

   Shows a graphical representation of the input including the column cross section and stress-strain models for the concrete, longitudinal reinforcement, and prestressing tendons.

**Moment-Curvature**

   Shows a tabular listing and a graph of the moment-curvature response of the column.

**Material Model Details**

   Shows details of the concrete, mild reinforcement, and unbonded tendon material models.

**Analysis Details**

   Shows tabular and graphical representation of the moment capacity analysis at the curvatures analyzed. The curvatures analyzed are in the drop down list.
