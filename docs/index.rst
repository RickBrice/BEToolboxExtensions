BEToolbox Extensions
====================

This project implements experimental extensions to BridgeLink::BEToolbox. These extensions are not intended for production engineering work. They are partially developed and have not been fully validated.

Moment Curvature of Circular Columns
------------------------------------
This extension computes the moment curvature response of circular columns with bonded and unbonded longitudinal reinforcement and unbonded prestressed tendons.

St. Venant Torsional Constant
-----------------------------
This extension computes the St. Venant Torsional Constant for precast, prestressed concrete bridge girders. Calculations are carried out by the finite difference method solving Prandtl's membrane analogy.

Other Experemental Aspects
--------------------------
The other experimental aspects of this project are

#. Experiment with generating documentation using reSTructured text
#. Generation of end user documentation with Sphinx and Read the Docs
